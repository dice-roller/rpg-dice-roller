# What notations are

Dice can be rolled through the use of "notations".
A notation is a simple string of characters that tells the parser which dice and modifiers to roll.

The format of the notation is based on the Wikipedia article [Dice Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation),
so it's consistent and conforms to a standard of sorts, albeit a very loose one.

We've then enhanced the notation to bring in extra functionality, that is not otherwise possible with the basic notation.


## Types

Our notation can be split into several types:

* [Dice](dice.md) - _The different types of dice that can be rolled (e.g. `d6`, `d20`, `dF`)._
* [Modifiers](modifiers.md) - _The modifiers that can affect dice rolls (e.g. "exploding", "Re-roll")._
* [Maths](maths.md) - _Generic mathematical equations._
